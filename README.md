# Auturgus: A Handyman App

(delete-One Paragraph of project description goes here)
This app is an Uber for handymen. A requester will choose from a list of very specific jobs/tasks/projects. The requester enter details about the project and receive  a quote. The requester will be prompted to pay for their service. Right now, only the requester side is complete. Future functionality will allow the "jobs" to be sent to a queue were the providers/service professionals can select the jobs.
